## General Business
 - Gozz: I've had a close relationship with Unigames and how they do some things
   - Particularly, the fresher campaigns they run are hugely important for fresher engagement
   - How can we replicate this?
   - Potentially: We lengthen training sessions, group fresheres into small groups, each group is led by an experienced member
   - Give them two or three problems, one using techniques from the day's session, one other problem
   - Get them to work together to solve the problems, more of a discussion style thing rather than actual programming
 - Max: how do we encourage them to work together?
   - Less focus on submitting code, more on talking to their team-mates
 - Gozz: we want this to be very socially focussed
 - NP: can work on some questions from the site to get running for tomorrow's session
 - Mark: when would the next contest be?
