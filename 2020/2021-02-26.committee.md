## General Business

- Nic: Mailchimp usage
  - Mailing lists are all set up just need to write content in
  - Click rate = 67% for our first email (we get past the spam filters!)
- Nic: Lecture Bashing
  - Emails sent to CITS1001, 2200 and 1401 UCs
    - Tom: 1001 and 2200 have said yes
  - ACTION @Tom: to send emails to CITS2401 and CITS2003
- Nic: Tenancy things
  - It was UPhilSoc that were moved to room 255 without us; they assumed we would prefer no room to a shared room outside CH
  - They also had a poor understanding of what our clubroom use is
  - The outcome: we may be going to share room 255 with PhilSoc if they are willing to do so, if not we are a priority applicant for room 183 if it becomes available
  - We should have a rolling tenancy application _just in case_
  - For now, we should accept any favourable outcome
