## General Business

### Lack of budgeting for O-day stall, flyers and stickers 
- If a committee member makes an unbudgeted expense, they should not assume that they will be reimbursed by The Club
    - Any expense should be budgeted beforehand!
- There are two sides to this argument
    - Gozz: We have to have the ability for members to make expenses that they think are justified, with no guarantee for reimbursement but the ability of the committee to do so if it is in the best interest of the club
    - Ryan: Per Volunteering WA docummentation, it is recommended that PCS should adopt a predictable reimbursement policy
- We don't have time to reach a consensus at this point
