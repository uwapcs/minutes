## Events
- Training - Nic
    - Strings is next week
    - Number theory is this week
    - We haven't done greedy algorithms yet should we do them soon?
        - Seamus: in how much depth?
            - You can have a whole session of greedy
        - Digression: Dadams on matroids
    - Could we do more maths for computer science stuff?
        - Computational geometry?
        - Dadams: Number theory could probably be two sessions
            - But the cost/benefit is dubious at best
    - Seamus: We could do tries then strings
        - We could do a whole session on trie algorithms
        - Can also talk about graph representations of strings
            - Suffix arrays, etc
    - Tom: State machines might be helpful
        - Seamus: Was slightly covered in intro prog, but not in training
        - Dadams: We have to mention GoL and Conway then
    - Dadams: Compiler optimization
        - Tom ran it in 2017
        - Tom: What languages?
            - C++/Python

    - Meeting for it is tomorrow (2020-04-29)
    - We could do a contest that runs from the 13th to the 16th
        - Release batches of questions each night
        - So there's lots of mini-contests in a single contest
        - Will require a lot of questions to be written/stolen
            - Probably around 12-16?
    - We can also run a content session at the same time
        - "Coding in PowerPoint" would be good fun
        - Alden: Let's have people compete - one in PowerPoint, one in Scratch
            - *Collective gasp of horror*
    - How do we monetize?
        - Contest is relatively straight forward
            - Hints
            - Time limit
            - Pay to pass is probably a bit much
        - Content
            - Do we even want to monetize it?
            - Maybe gate on entry?
            - If we're going to be contributing to a GitHub repository: Pay to
            have your name on the commit?
            - Pay to reduce the length of explanations
    - Organization of the event is going pretty well
    - What platform should we use to engage people?
        - YouTube might not work
        - Probably should be more freeform and private
        - Seamus: We could use YouTube + Discord, but Zoom might be easier
    - We don't know if there's a central way to organize people yet
