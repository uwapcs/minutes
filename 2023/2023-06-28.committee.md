- 15% penalty for not attending SOCPAC meeting on 30/05. On the minutes, our attendence is recorded as absent.
    - Will be appealed - Jesse has a photo of the attendence form since he was there in person.
    - Minimum guaranteed $690, potentially $1300.

### Club PayPal Account
- Opening paypal account to handle Digital Ocean payments. Link it to club's bank account.

- MOTION: To open Club PayPal Account
    - For: 6 Against: 0
    - Unanimously passes.
    - ACTION: Trung: Create and open club Paypal account.

### Westpac Debit Card
- Before doing Paypal account, this was the intial thought to handle Digital Ocean payments.
- Debit card is not worth the risk if we have a PayPal.

### Westpac EFTPOS Air
- Accept EFTPOS payments with phone and its directly through Westpac.
- So for O-Day and Club Carnival we can get payments using our phones rather than transferring money.
- Multiple phones can use it by anyone who could sign into the Westpac account. 
    - We can open up restricted accounts.
    - New committee will have access when signatories are changed.
- There is a fee for transactions 1.4% which is significantly lower than other payment transfer methods.
    - We lose 7c, but will probably get more people signing up.
- There is a promotion, if we sign up right now, we get $100.
    - We need to take $1000 worth of transactions to qualify
