## Vice Pres's report

## Treasurer's report
Apologise for last weeks' absence - had to attend a family medical issue on short notice! 

This week:
- Pink sleeps are SIGNED and are on their way to Guild to process. 
- Consolidated some ideas on shirts
   - Jumpers/Hoodies too impractical (can only really use them for ~4 months of the year)
   - Likely to cost ~$20-25 for Committee shirts 
   - We can also have a more understated PCS shirt that does not have the logo, but 
   a PCS design. The idea here is to sell it above cost price (maybe $30 for a $25 t-shirt). 
   - I think this would be a nice way to raise some small funds from club members. 
   - Options to be discussed in General Business
