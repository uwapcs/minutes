## General Business

### Shirts and Stickers

- Bea: We should do a run of shirts and stickers
- General agreement that shirts are cool
  - ACTION @Bea: Bring some shirt designs and costings to committee
- General agreement that stickers are cool
  - Gozz: And cheap
  - ACTION @Bea: Bring some sticker designs and costings to committee

### Online Payments

- Bea: A lot of people have asked about online payments
- Gozz: From historical experience I can tell you this is difficult
  - Our "bank account" with Guild Finance is not actually a bank account
  - All clubs accounts are just in one big account, and Finance do their own bookkeeping within that
  - For a payment to actually go to "our account", we need Finance to create an invoice with an invoice number
  - Guild has a few card readers, but you have to book those out and can't book them for ODay or Club Carnival
  - To accept electronic payments by any other form requires us to have a proper bank account
    - This has its own complexities, but is probably the most practical solution
- ACTION @Bea: Research options for taking electronic payments
