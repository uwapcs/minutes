## Semester 1 Recap (~30 minutes)
* Survey results (~~only 2 responses :')~~ 7 now!)
    * Most students are undergrads
        * This is to be expected
    * Everyone is programming in python
        * Except that one dude doing julia (*cough* tim chapman)
    * Everyone has participated in a contest this year
    * Most people has attended workshops
    * Some content was difficult
    * Another feedback section only included people not having time and requests for shared drive content
* Workshops are useful:
  * 6/7 of respondees wrote a note on the usefulness of the material
  * 6/6 of these notes were positive
  * Good balance of Intro to Comp. Prog., and Intro to programming mentioned.
* Improvements:
  * More time in workshops to do problems
  * Some comments on it being too theory-heavy in workshops
    * [Ryan] I think we can split subjects up more
  * Computational geometry

* General comments
  * A lot of people are finding some of our content overwhelming 
      * Perhaps put little tips and tricks in the newsletter or reminders of our shared resources
      * The club has a reputation of being intimidating
  * People are signing up and not turing up
      * We seem cool but scary
  * Integrate access to our resources when people sign up for the mailing list
  * People are finding the club intimidating 
      * The word 'Competitive' scares people away 
      * Need to rethink marketing
  * Pods are a good way to introduce people to the area
      * Need to stress that the objective is learning
  * Could collaborate with Women in STEM/Engineering
  * Could collaborate with Guild Womens Department 
      * Has been explored in the past was not good
      * Perhaps need more support in the pods
          * Could explore deliberately grouping kinds of people
  * Should include a pronouns section in the membership forms
      * Definitely include in next years form
  * Intimidation free introductions
      * An issue for everyone
      * Discord is good for combating this
      * webpage is not very friendly
          * Could move Dmoj to a subdomain so rest of website can be more approachable 
  * Membership progression
      * People tend to come for intro to programming and then are funneled into competitive programming
  * User manual  (Fresher Guide)
      * Current resources page is a good starting point
          * Should be more personalized 
          * Quickstart guide or fresher guide 
      * Website needs a better content delivery system


### Competitions

### Workshops

#### Competitive Programming
What did we run?
  * Intro to Competitive Programming
  * Sorting
  * Searching
  * String Structures
      * Spent a lot of time on the basic (too much)
      * Difference between representation and actual algorithms hard to balance
      * Going through actual examples was difficult, as people zoned out 
      * Conceptually challenging problems cause a lot of problems
      * Should run this with examples 
      * Write a Gym specifically for a hard algorithm
          * break the problems down and approach one by one
      * For strings specifically there is an issue with conceptual understanding versus semantic 
      * Need to figure out where these algorithms go
          * Take list of algorithms to cover and split it across various sessions
      * Have a session on just dealing with strings in a persons language of choice and how to manipulate them
          * Perhaps not a session but a resource on how to use them
          * Could have a hackerrank style here is how to do it and then apply it to a different problem (especially in different languages)
  * Graphs pt. 1
      * lots of talking less implementation
      * Could have an evening online session working on graph algorithms and representation in a specific languages
      * Also need to cover setting up the architecture of how to write code in a competition setting
          * Weather to run it in c++ or python
          * Perhaps java to bridge the understanding gap vs the technical gap
  * Graphs pt. 2
      * Was difficult according to participants
      * Being clear in presentation in important
          * Practice running sessions is important
      * Explaining how to learn the algorithm is difficult
      * Having a gym or practice examples that are approachable is important
          * Learn by doing
  * Greedy Algorithms
  * Dynamic programming
      * Needs multiple sessions

What went right?
What can we improve?

#### Intro to Programming
What did we run?
  * Intro to Programming (x3 weeks)
  * Outro to Programming
  * Git
  * Linux foo
  * Quantum computing (x2 weeks)

What went right?
  * has been good
what can we improve?
  * could be done as a oneshot on a saturday 
      * Possibly run around week 3

### Social

## Semester 2 Training session plans (~30 minutes)
### Content
* Feedback has been graphs might need another run

### Format
* Interest in online + in-person workshops
* Recording is also a possibility

### Preliminary Plan

1. Intro to competitive programming (Nic)
2. Intro to graphs (Ryan)
3. Graphs 2 (Michael with Alan backup)
4. Dynamic programming (Gozz)

Computational Geometry (Gozz)
Graph Flow (Alan)

- Week 3 weekend run intro to programming oneshot
- Intro to programming should be run in full again 
    - Should be run not in week one so better advertising


## Handover for 2022 Committee (~30 Minutes)
* See 2021 template
* What session to run in the first few weeks?
* Might become an end of semester task

## Semester 2 Social Events (~15 minutes)

* Fresher welcome part 2
* a games night is a possibility at some point


## Problem writing workshop (~30 minutes)

* feat. Nic.
* Meta a+b 
    * Write the a+b of writing a+b
