## Events
 - Charity Vigil
   - It's going pretty well
   - We need more debate topics
     - We should entreat our members for this on the facebook page or somesuch
   - We have some more google swag to give away as prizes
     - But the request for fewer larger prizes has been lost, so we still only have small items
     - Max: We should consider giving some of these things away as prizes for teams that do well at ANZAC
   - We should try and get some particular larger items for the raffle, so that they can actually have some appeal
     - These would be funded by the club
     - UCC does steam vouchers etc., UWAnime does a subscription to <insert Anime site name>
     - Ideas for what we could get:
       - A mechanical keyboard? 
       - Cloud credits?
       - Credit for other games or things?
       - A rubber duck?
       - A sublime text subscription?
         - Lots of these things would be too expensive or not applicable to most people
       - Get some competitive programming style games?
         - TIS-100, Exapunks, etc.
         - There are a bunch of such games
         - This seems like our best option
         - Action: Gozz - Sort out our game based prizes and how to get them
 - Training Sessions for week 8 (this week)
   - Do we want to run them this week?

## General Business
 - Training sessions for next year

   - Maybe just start with Wednesday, then look into whether members would prefer another time
   - Action: Theo - Book training session rooms for next year
 - T-Shirts
   - Now that we have the committee ones, we're happy with the quality and would be interested
   - We should look into doing t-shirts for winning teams at the upcoming competitions
     - Take the top N teams such that the number of members who haven't won shirts yet is at least 3, give all of those people shirts
