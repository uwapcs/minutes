## Events
- Nic: Training
    - Event is up for training tomorrow
    - Tree algorithms pt.1 tomorrow by Seamus

        - Can use to go into our Charity Vigil contest
        - Explain how the donations + wackiness will work
    - Then more tree algorithms
        - More advanced things
    - Stream seems to be going well
        - Attendance will be low because that's how things are atm
        - Zahra: we can keep them in storage for later use

- Nic: Charity Vigil
    - Contest
        - 12 problems over 3 batches
        - There is a question prep channel in Slack for people that are not
        planning on competing
        - We have 5 easy problems, 3 harder problems at the moment
        - Flavor text being about the clubs would be fantastic
            - We can point people to those clubs' resources
    - Programming in PowerPoint session
        - Talk about Turing completeness
            - Worth mentioning, but we don't have a spot for it in our regularly
            scheduled programming
        - Who to have prep?
            - Dadams had the original idea, but he might be overloaded
            - Gozz might be able to wing it
        - Monetization for this is really hard
            - Feels a bit weird
            - Gozz: how do we monetize our stuff anyway?
                - You ideally want to play people off each other
                - "Donate to decide what we do, etc."
                - Maybe have monetization take a backseat and point to other
                clubs
    - Roles to be filled
        - Ryan is getting raffle prizes
        - For monetized contests, we need someone to act as judge for some
        number of hours
            - Automation of things would be really hard
    - How to get people to interact with things?
        - Slack can help get people through to the contest
        - We should have a look at what UCC's doing once its up
        - Programming in PowerPoint stuff might have to be done in Zoom
            - Zahra: does Discord work?
                - Nic: No recording
                    - Tom: OBS exists
                - Gozz: Discord is the most general functional thing
                    - Only bad thing is camera meetings of over 10 people
            - Would we want to set up a Discord for this event?
                - Most clubs use Discord, we could try it out as a different
                system
                - Gozz: It's in our interest to eventually move to Discord
                - ACTION: Nic to setup a Discord for Charity Vigil
                    - If it works well, we can keep it

## General Business

    - Not even a meeting, literally just a recording

## Postmortem
*Meeting Closed: 16:49*
###  Digressions: 5
- Gozz: Running GNOME with NVIDIA cards
    - Can't run portrait monitors
    - Makes Gozz sad
    - If you try to have portrait monitors, the monitor gets disconnected
    - The cause seems to be NVIDIA's proprietary drivers assume that you're
    using X and have an Xorg.conf
    - So XRandr calls done by GNOME don't work
        - Works until you reboot :(
    - Basically requires NVidia not being trash
    - Pop!_OS says its a GNOME problem
        - GNOME says its an NVIDIA modesetting problem
        - NVIDIA is NVIDIA
- Gozz: Windows wouldn't let Gozz adjust volume
    - Everything is too loud
    - Tom: *THIS IS WHY WE USE LINUX*
    - Gozz is now deaf
- Gozz: Online Code Challenge
    - The editor that they give you is trash
    - You can't C+P, why?
    - Run through 3rd party
    - Only questions about the process remain
- Tom: GNOME Zoom bugs
    - Opening and closing windows confuses GNOME
    - Clicking on the Zoom icon in the dock crashes GNOME
- Gozz: Facebook now looks like a mobile app
    - We all wish we didn't need Facebook, but its required
    - Gozz: Discord as primary communication method seems like a good idea
