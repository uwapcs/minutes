## Postmortem
_Meeting Closed_: _15:31_

### Digressions: 


_It was noted that Ekaterina may have spent more than necessary on the cybersecurity event without prior consultation with the club. Specifically, an initial budget of $10 was considered, but $50 was ultimately spent on speaker-related costs. This decision appeared to be made somewhat hastily and without full communication._

_Alec and Ekaterina had a discussion regarding differing perspectives on the current state and size of the club-particularly whether it is growing or in decline-and whether it is financially prudent to allocate funds to speakers who volunteer their time._

_They also engaged in a constructive conversation about improving communication and planning for the clubâ€™s future direction._
