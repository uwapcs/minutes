## General Business
 - Max: We need to move slides over to the shared folder
   - Action: Nic P - Move slides to shared folder
 - Nick O: All ready to order the shirts if we're ready to pay etc.
   - We'll try a trial run with the Gold shirts for the people who got this rank
     - Action: Mark - Organising Payment for the sample shirts
     - Probably as a reimbursement, Nick O will pay for the shirts then be reimbursed from the club
   - Then order some general club shirts
   - We'll change the Yellow rank on our club site to a Burnt Orange to make it a more appealing shirt
 - Nick P: Finished coordinating the Unigames collab event
   - EMP is in, everything is nicely prepared
 - Nick P: How is the next competition going?
   - Tom: Some people have expressed interest in writing questions
   - Nick P: Do we want another team contest or another Individual contest?
     - Gozz: Perhaps a Team contest where we ask people to register their teams?
     - Max: Team contests are more difficult to make though, and we have the team contest coming up with University of Melbourne.
     - Gozz: So our next contest should be an individual contest.
 - Max: The collab contest with University of Melbourne can be a standin for some of the Missing ANZAC contests
   - As there are some issues with the ANZAC contests this year
   - We might open up our current contests to let other people compete
     - We will need some more judge servers though, as the current setup won't handle the load
   - This would also help with the void created by the issues with ANZAC contests
   - Gozz: We also want to move to a new server at some point though, this could be a good precursor to this.
     - As we've been having other issues with the UCC server
     - Gozz: Does someone have a spare computer that can be used as a server?
     - Tom: I have a computer that would work well for that
     - Gozz: We can try setting up all our judges on that computer, and just fire it up when we're running a contest
     - Max: But we need at least one server for practice questions
 - Max: We need more people competing in contests.
   - What if at some point we have a contest instead of a training session?
   - Because a lot of people have been coming to training sessions but not competing
 - Max: Should we advertise our contests to the CS department in general?
   - Nick O: What about just advertising the club in general?
   - Gozz: What if the next contest is open to all comers and advertise this specifically to CS students?
   - Max: And we can get a Tim and Amitava to advertise in their lectures
