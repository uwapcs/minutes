## General Business

### Committee Appointment
- Intended process goes as follows: Interim candidates assigned, then OGM is assigned when possible to ratify them if no other candidates want them. If it's unrealistic to do another vote (i.e close to end of year), permanently assign them.
- Better if we did the appointment quicker, then an OGM
- Discuss possible OGM

- pcs.org.au has been renewed for 3 years
- pcs.au domain application is pending
