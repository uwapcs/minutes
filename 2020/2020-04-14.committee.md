## Postmortem
*Meeting Closed: 17:02*
###  Digressions: 13
- Tries and Systems Programming assignments
- A wild Taylor appears
- Life members and how we track them
    - Only in AGM minutes
    - Only Tim French atm
    - Gozz is planning on figuring this out with Autocrat, which will be coming soon(tm)
        - Autocrat is a planned automatic bureaucracy
- Gozz likes Discord
    - Ryan likes the audio quality
        - Gozz: chat is a secondary feature, audio is the primary feature
    - Unigames and UCC are doing well with Discord
- Evil ideas about Charity Vigil
- Training for World Finals with Albert
    - They wanted a code notebook, but maybe there's a smart way to make sure you don't mess up
    your code
    - Have something that runs line by line with the preprocessor and a cumulative hash to check
    against your notebook
- What happens if you loudly talk about solving problems with DP?
    - A fun time with Gozz and Max
- Albert has apparently moved to being a physics major
- Code Jam is two words, not one word
    - So is Kick Start
- Guild Finance does a dumb thing where they match deductions against additions
    - The format exported from NetSuite is really bad
    - Gozz has a way to deal with them [here](https://netsuite.gozz.id.au)
        - It's <ins>**Open Source**</ins>(tm)!
- Nic: new digression format is cool
    - What will be longer, the actual minutes, or the digressions?
    - Find out on the next episode!
- How to say "to be continued" in Japanese
    - Gozz is a weeb
- Gozz: The landing page is set up to *have* to be a blog post
    - Maybe we can set the "about" page to just be a blog post
    - We can make the landing page not point to DMOJ
    - Nic: if we roll our own membership system and stuff, we can make DMOJ just our competition
    system
    - More fragmentation works well if you can fragment by purpose
