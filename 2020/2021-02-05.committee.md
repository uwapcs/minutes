### Digressions: 3
- Dadams: "I'M SITTING IN MY CAR BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE WORKS WITH DISCORD!"
- Gozz doing a hackerrank problem
  - On the sample inputs has wrong answer
  - On the "hard" things its correct
- Would the sheets of CLRS cover the entirety of our clubroom walls?
  - Gozz thinks yes
  - Tom thinks probably not
  - By Gozz's estimate it would take 681 A4 pages to wallpaper the room
    - Includes the windows
    - CLRS is 1300 pages
