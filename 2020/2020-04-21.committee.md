## President's report
- Watched Dadams present graph theory
- Attended Charity Vigil meeting
- Attended CSSE feedback session

## Vice Pres's report
- Watched graph theory
- Did CodeJam 1B
    - Did awfully
    - Needs to work on implementation
- DP Slides
    - Still using Max's slides
    - Wants to try to present multiple ways of looking at DPs
    - DAG stuff is mathematically provable, but to people that have just learnt
    what a DAG is, it wouldn't be that intuitive
    - Alden: Are you including recurrent sequences that turn out to be DAGs?
        - Yes

## Treasurer's report
- Chased up UCC
- Need to pay UCC
- Need to reimburse Nic for Digital Ocean
- Ostensibly involved in Charity vigil
- CSSE Feedback session was during supervisor meeting
    - Still unhappy that CITS3003 remains unchanged since I started my degree. 
    - CITS3003: (Graphics)

- Needs to chase up Guild about actually being a Treasurer
- ACTION: Nic to chase up Guild about exec roles

## OCM's report (Dadams)
- "Why hello there"
    - Tom: "Hi Obiwan"
- Did Graphs 2
    - Slides bad
    - Presentation good
- Is doing number theory slides
    - Doesn't help that all the maths that is currently being studied doesn't
    have much application to computer science

    - Asked questions

## OCM's report (Alden)
- Did Google Online Challenge
    - Got two problems about binary trees
    - Cheers Max/Gozz for teaching heap indexing
    - Turns out reading all the problems is a good idea
- Competed in Code Jam 1B
    - Proving a lower bound is occasionally a good idea
        - For "join the ranks"

## IPP report
Playing HL: Alyx

## Events
- Training
    - Zahra: The order of the next two training session?
        - Dynamic Programming, then Number Theory
    - We were intending on filling the rest of the semester out with whatever
    we see fit
        - We could save strings for next semester as introductory material
    - Nic: How much of trees have we covered?
        - We could do Fenwick Trees, etc.
        - Dadams: barely anything, only that they are a DAG
        - We could have trees be the session after number theory
    - Seamus: Is there a point to teaching Fenwick Trees?
        - Whatever a Fenwick Tree can do, a segment tree can do better
        - Nic: Maybe should be taught anyway
    - Nic: We should also cover flow
        - Hasn't been done for a while
        - Can easily be a whole session
    - Next few sessions
        - Dynamic Programming
        - Number Theory
        - Trees
    - Nic: are we happy with YouTube?
        - Dadams: Somewhere with better latency would be good
            - It's 30 seconds delay by default
            - Nic: Maybe everything goes through a content filter?
            - Zahra: Maybe auto-gen subtitles?
        - Zoom is still an option
        - Twitch is an option
            - May have delay as well
            - Seamus: you can have almost real time
        - Discord is an option if we record
        - We'll do one more week with YouTube
        - ACTION: Nic to test YouTube low latency
- Nic: ANZAC 2

    - Need to pass budget for the event (~$100)
        - There will a raffle and prizes

        a prize of ~$60
    - Need to pass charity support for the event
    - Need to agree and commit to our event contributions
        - Would like to commit to something solid
        - Run a contest and monetise it somehow?
            - Have spicy rules
            - We could run one over the 3 days
            - Run a mini-contest over one of the nights
        - Could run a content session
            - e.g. Game Theory for games with unigames
            - e.g. "How to run a Competitive Programming Club"
            - e.g. "How to code in PowerPoint"
        - Nic: Could we commit to a contest and content session?

        - It's likely to be a Steam key or something similar
    - Subcommittee meets on Wednesdays at 5PM, so more information will be
    available after that

## General Business
- CSSE feedback session
    - Most of it was on assessments, and how they were going to work
    - FAQ has a lot of helpful information on opting-out of Examplify
    - You must opt-in to an ungraded pass after you know your mark
        - You can't do it before
    - They are looking to expand the number of units taught
        - Are kind of strapped by all the beaurocracy
        - There was talk of removing CITS3003 as a core unit
    - The course is up for accreditation next year
    - They are looking for feedback from students, with the point that the
    changes should be minor, not major
    - Ryan: Are the feedback sessions exclusively undergrad focussed?
        - No, although most of the discussion was about it
        - Ryan: Then with regards to MPE, there's not enough undergrad rigor
        for the Software specialization
            - You can do it without having written much code at all
    - Ryan: There's Masters of IT: Open Source Software and Tooling unit
        - Run by Chris MacDonald
        - Could it perhaps become a complementary unit for the CS stream?
- The CSSE staff are feeling a bit lonely without students in class
    - They want feedback from students in general on how to get more out of the
    students
- The book
    - Zahra: We could ask our members what they'd like information about
