## Agenda
### Optiver Sponsorship and event on the 20/3/2024
- Jesse has contacted Optiver, and Optiver wants to hold a trading workshop-style event about market volatility with prizes on the 20/3/2024, from 6-8pm AWST
  - Event details: What to Expect: Volatility Lab: Predicting the Markets with Maths and Tech - Volatility is one of the most prominent terms you will hear on any trading floor â€“ and for good reason! In financial markets, volatility captures the amount of fluctuation in prices.. For trading firms like Optiver, accurately predicting volatility is essential for the trading of options, whose price is directly related to the volatility of the underlying product. In this workshop, students will learn how to develop cutting-edge models for predicting volatility across a range of US stocks.
- We will be responsible for booking the room, promoting the event, and we will invoice them for catering after the event.
- ACTION: @Jesse : contact Optiver and confirm event availability and invoicing

## General Business
### Succession Plan
- Only one member will be taking a position on the new committee (Jesse, as a non-executive).
